### Hello!

This challenge focused on TDD and program deisgn.

The brief was to create a programme 'recipe' for a given short user brief. 
This recipe was then used to write tests for my proposed function. 
The function was then built up gradually by checking it against the written tests.

After all tests were working the code was refactored to make it more readable and efficient. 

Pytest can be ran from within the main folder.

The program recipe (recipe.md) can be found in the main folder.
